# An Example  [cucumber-jvm](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm) Project using Maven
This is an example maven cucumber jvm project that uses maven to build and run some simple scenarios based around withdrawing cash from an ATM.

## Background

Cucumber-JVM is a test automation tool following the principles of Behavioural Driven Design and living documentation. Specifications are written in a concise human readable form and executed in continuous integration. 

## Use

After you have installed maven: mvn clean install will run the tests and produce the test output. There are 3 report formatters - 1 on the console which prints pretty results to the console, there is an html report which gets generated in the target/cucumber directory and finally there is a cucumber.json report which gets published to the target directory.

Some of the tests pass and some fail to illustrate how they look.
